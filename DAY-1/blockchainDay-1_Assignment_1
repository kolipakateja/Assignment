ASSIGNMENT-1 DAY-1 BLOCK CHAIN

1)What is your understanding of Blockchain?
  The blockchain is a distributed database of records of all transactions or digital event that have been 
  executed and shared among participating parties.Each transaction verified by the majority of participants
  of the system.one of the famous example of vlock chain is Bitcoin, Bitcoin uses cryptographic proof instead
  of third-party trust for two parties to execute transactions over the internet.Blockchain technology is first
  came when a person or individual name called "Satoshi Nakamoto" published on white paper.


2)What is the core problem Blockchain trying to solve?
    At the moment, sending money to another either domestically or internationally requires the use of a third party,
    be it your local bank.these may charges some fee and we additionally,we must trust these third parties in how they
   handle our data.Blockchain technology allows for individuals to send cryptocurrencies between one another as a 
   transfer of value. This is done without needing to rely on third parties.


3)What are the few features which Blockchain will give you?
    ->decentralized
    ->distributed data base
   ->immutable
   ->tamper-proof
   ->provide peer to peer network


4)What all things does a Block contain?
    a)block number
    b)Transaction record
    c)previous record block
    d)mining key


5)How is the verifiability of Block chain is been obtained?
   Enterprise looking to leverage the peer to peer trustless structure of blockchain technology often wonder how data
   can be both publicly verifiable and anonymous at the same time,we have two types of block chains there are permissioned 
   and permissionless blockchains.In permissionless blockchain any one can join in the network,but in permissioned it need 
  some specific authorization.
